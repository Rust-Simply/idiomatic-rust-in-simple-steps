# Idiomatic Rust in Simple Steps

Welcome to IRISS 👁️🦀

Rust has a reputation of being difficult to learn, certainly it was when I learned back in 2017. While its true that
there remain some rough edges, the language is now easier to pick up than ever, and in many ways is much easier than
a lot of more established languages.

The goal of this series is to help you go from no knowledge of Rust to understanding how Rust is written as quickly as
possible.

This book is the written version of a companion 
[YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW2L8KbM0O7aRi_Bt4YE1JuW9EdMs0ztR) (coming soon)

If you spot a problem with this guide (I'm only human 😅), please file an Issue or even a PR on the
[project repository](https://github.com/Gisleburt/idiomatic-rust-in-simple-steps) and I will be incredibly grateful.
I certainly don't know _everything_ about Rust and look forward to learning new things throughout this project.

In the meantime, you should start by [deciding if Rust is definitely the language for you](./introduction/why.md), and
what [other learning resources](./introduction/resources.md) are available.
